# Economics Stencils

<img src="Pictures/All.jpg?sanitize=true&raw=true" />

I was watching our son doing course work for his degree and Econimics and he seemed to
be spending far too long drawing graphs by hand. That gave me the idea to produce a set
of stencils that can be used to draw all the standard graphs tha he was having to draw.

They were coded using OpenScad "The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller". OpenSCAD is a free
tool that can be found here: https://openscad.org/

They were all printed on a simple 3d printer. In this case an Ender-3.

There are 6 stencils
